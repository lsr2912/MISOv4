# MISOv4
Branched version of Serials Solutions MISO Sushi client to support COUNTER v4 report set

Anne Osterman at the VIrtual Library of Virginia was generous enough to support the development
and extension of the original Serials Solutions MISO client (found here : https://code.google.com/archive/p/sushicounterclient/).

This code was extended and constructed using the Community 2015 version of Microsoft Visual Studio, and
represents a decent, albeit amature, attempt to support the COUNTER-4 set of reports within a runtime
environment similar to the original MISO application.

There is much room forimprovement here, and more eyes, attention, and testing are needed since the
code will only be thoroughly exercised after hitting multiple vendor Sushi targets and report-types.
