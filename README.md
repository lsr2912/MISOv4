# MISOv4
Branched version of Serials Solutions MISO Sushi client to support COUNTER v4 report set

The Virtual Library of Virginia supported the development and extension of the original Serials Solutions MISO client (found here : https://code.google.com/archive/p/sushicounterclient/).

This code was extended and constructed using the Community 2015 version of Microsoft Visual Studio, and represents a first  attempt at supporting the COUNTER-4 set of reports within a runtime environment similar to the original MISO application.

There is much room for improvement here, and more eyes, attention, and testing are needed since the code will only be thoroughly exercised after hitting multiple vendor SUSHI targets and COUNTER report types.
